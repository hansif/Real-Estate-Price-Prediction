         PRICE PREDICTION ML PROJECT OVERVIEW

- PROBLEM TEARDOWN
* we are given datasets of house prices with some features like   no.of bathrooms, no. of bedrooms
* we have to create a model that predict price for any new house by looking at features
* we will work with real data sets among the hundred of data sets

- GETTING STARTED
* The first question is what is the business objective and end goal of the object
* With the model it should predict house prices and invest in its area if undervalued
* more accurate the predictions more benefit for the real estate companies

- FINDING THE CORRECT TYPE OF MODEL TO WORK UPON
* some of the question that arises is what type of model to be used among these :-
1) Supervised, Unsupervised or Reinforcement learning
2) Classification or Regression
3) Batch Learning or Online Learning techniques
* The answer is it is supervised learning that comes under regression task and the learning is batch learning (datasets are already present and the model is already built on it)

- SELECTING A PREFORMANCE MEASURE
* A typical performance measure for regression problem is root mean square error (RMSE)
* It is the better algorithm to try in regression problems

- CHECKING ASSUMPTIONS
* It is very important to make correct assumptions
* Here we need not classify the prices as only regression is required and just find out the price.

- CODING ENVIRONMENT
* Jupyter notebook is one of the most prescribed open source web application for coding ml in python
* Easy documentation and notebook like features help in understanding
